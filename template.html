          <p>LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los
            Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. He is often regarded as the greatest basketball
            player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[1][2] His accomplishments
            include three NBA championships, four NBA MVP Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold
            medals. Lebron's teams appeared in eight consecutive NBA Finals (2011-2018 seasons). Lebron leads with the
            record for all-time NBA playoffs points scored, is third in all-time NBA points scored, and eighth in
            all-time NBA assists. James was selected to the All-NBA First Team a record twelve times, made the
            All-Defensive First Team five times, played in sixteen NBA All-Star Games as All-Star MVP three times.
